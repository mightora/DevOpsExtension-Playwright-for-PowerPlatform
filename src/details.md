# Playwright for Power Platform DevOps Extension

Revolutionize your Power Platform testing with automated end-to-end testing using Playwright in Azure DevOps pipelines. This extension provides a complete testing solution that automatically sets up the testing environment, executes comprehensive UI tests against your Power Apps, and generates detailed reports with advanced failure analysis.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This extension requires Windows runners and is only compatible with Windows-based Azure DevOps pipeline agents.**

## Why Choose Playwright for Power Platform Testing?

Traditional Power Platform testing often requires manual effort and lacks integration with CI/CD pipelines. This extension bridges that gap by providing:

- **Zero Configuration Setup**: Automatically installs and configures the entire Playwright testing environment
- **Power Platform Optimized**: Pre-configured for Power Apps authentication and common testing scenarios  
- **Enterprise Ready**: Designed for Azure DevOps with comprehensive reporting and failure analysis
- **Multi-Browser Coverage**: Test across all major browsers to ensure consistent user experience

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Environment Setup
The extension handles all the complexity of setting up a Playwright testing environment:
- Downloads and installs Node.js if not present
- Clones a specialized Playwright framework designed for Power Platform
- Installs all required npm dependencies and Playwright browsers
- Configures the testing environment with your specific parameters

### 2. Intelligent Test Execution  
- Copies your test files to the configured testing framework
- Sets up environment variables for Power Platform authentication
- Executes tests with your chosen browser configuration
- Captures comprehensive data during test execution

### 3. Advanced Failure Analysis
When tests fail, you get detailed insights:
- **Screenshots**: Visual evidence of exactly what was on screen when tests failed
- **Video Recordings**: Complete recordings of test execution for thorough analysis
- **Trace Files**: Step-by-step execution traces showing every action and its result
- **Network Logs**: HTTP requests and responses to identify connectivity issues
- **Error Extraction**: Specific error messages pulled from test results

### 4. Comprehensive Reporting
Multiple report formats ensure compatibility with your workflow:
- **HTML Reports**: Interactive reports perfect for sharing with stakeholders
- **JSON Results**: Machine-readable results for integration with other tools
- **JUnit XML**: Compatible with most CI/CD reporting systems
- **Screenshots & Videos**: Visual evidence automatically attached to results

- **User Role Management**: Assign and remove security roles for users dynamically during test execution.
- **Team Assignment**: Add users to specific teams to test team-based workflows and permissions.
- **Business Unit Configuration**: Update user business units to validate access and functionality across organizational structures.

These features are designed to streamline testing for enterprise-level Power Platform applications, ensuring that user-specific configurations are handled seamlessly within CI/CD pipelines.

## Setup & Configuration

### Prerequisites
- **Windows-based Azure DevOps pipeline agent** (Linux and macOS agents are not supported)
- Power Platform application URL
- Test user credentials with appropriate permissions
- Playwright test files written in JavaScript or TypeScript

### Basic Configuration
1. Ensure your Azure DevOps pipeline uses a **Windows agent** (e.g., `windows-latest`, `windows-2022`, or `vs2017-win2016`)
2. Install the extension in your Azure DevOps organization
3. Add the Playwright for Power Platform task to your pipeline
4. Configure the required parameters:
   - Test location path
   - Target browser(s)  
   - Power Platform app URL
   - Authentication credentials
5. Optionally enable trace mode for detailed debugging

### Example Pipeline YAML
```yaml
# Ensure you're using a Windows agent
pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

steps:
- task: mightoria-playwrightForPowerPlatform@1
  displayName: 'Run Power Platform Tests'
  inputs:
    testLocation: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/tests'
    browser: 'chromium'
    trace: 'retain-on-failure'
    outputLocation: '$(Agent.TempDirectory)/test-results'
    appUrl: 'https://apps.powerapps.com/play/$(AppId)'
    appName: 'MyPowerApp'
    o365Username: '$(TestUser.Email)'
    o365Password: '$(TestUser.Password)'

- task: PublishTestResults@2
  condition: always()
  inputs:
    testResultsFormat: 'JUnit'
    testResultsFiles: '$(Agent.TempDirectory)/test-results/**/*.xml'
    testRunTitle: 'Power Platform UI Tests'

- task: PublishHtmlReport@1
  condition: always()
  inputs:
    reportDir: '$(Agent.TempDirectory)/test-results/playwright-report'
    tabName: 'Test Report'
```

## Common Test Scenarios

### Authentication Testing
```javascript
test('Office 365 Login Flow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(process.env.APP_URL);
  await page.fill('[name="loginfmt"]', process.env.O365_USERNAME);
  await page.click('[type="submit"]');
  await page.fill('[name="passwd"]', process.env.O365_PASSWORD);
  await page.click('[type="submit"]');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(new RegExp(process.env.APP_NAME));
});
```

### Canvas App Testing
```javascript
test('Form Submission Workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(process.env.APP_URL);
  // Wait for Power Apps to load
  await page.waitForSelector('[data-automation-id="Canvas"]');
  
  // Interact with Power Apps controls
  await page.click('[aria-label="Name input"]');
  await page.fill('[aria-label="Name input"]', 'Test User');
  await page.click('[aria-label="Submit button"]');
  
  // Verify success message
  await expect(page.locator('[aria-label="Success message"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues
- **Authentication Failures**: Verify credentials and ensure test user has appropriate permissions
- **Element Not Found**: Check for Power Platform loading delays and add appropriate waits
- **Timeout Errors**: For slow-loading environments, consider increasing the default timeout in your Playwright configuration or tests.
