# Playwright for Power Platform DevOps Extension

Automate end-to-end testing of your Power Platform applications with Playwright in Azure DevOps pipelines. This extension provides a comprehensive testing solution that sets up Playwright, executes tests against Power Apps, and generates detailed reports with failure analysis for CI/CD workflows.

## Overview

The **Playwright for Power Platform DevOps Extension** is a specialized Azure DevOps task that enables automated UI testing of Power Platform applications using the Playwright testing framework. This extension eliminates the complexity of setting up testing environments by automatically installing dependencies, configuring authentication, and executing comprehensive test suites.

Built specifically for Power Platform applications, this extension handles the unique challenges of testing Power Apps, including Office 365 authentication flows, dynamic loading patterns, and Power Platform-specific UI controls.

## Key Features

### üöÄ **Zero-Configuration Setup**

- Automatic artifact collection and organization

## How It Works

1. **Environment Setup**: Automatically installs Node.js and Playwright testing framework
2. **Test Preparation**: Copies your test files and configures environment variables
3. **Test Execution**: Runs your Playwright tests with Power Platform optimizations
4. **Result Analysis**: Generates comprehensive reports with failure diagnostics

## Getting Started

    appUrl: 'https://apps.powerapps.com/play/$(AppId)'
    appName: 'MyPowerApp'
    o365Username: '$(TestUser.Email)'
    o365Password: '$(TestUser.Password)'
```

### Advanced Usage with Custom Repository *(New in v1.0.15)*

```yaml
- task: mightoria-playwrightForPowerPlatform@1
  displayName: 'Run Tests with Custom Framework'
  inputs:
    testLocation: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/tests'
    playwrightRepository: 'https://github.com/yourorg/custom-playwright-framework.git'
    playwrightBranch: 'feature/enhanced-selectors'
    browser: 'chromium'
    trace: 'on-first-retry'
    outputLocation: '$(Agent.TempDirectory)/test-results'
    appUrl: 'https://apps.powerapps.com/play/$(AppId)'
    appName: 'MyPowerApp'
    o365Username: '$(TestUser.Email)'
    o365Password: '$(TestUser.Password)'
```

### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Required | Default |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `testLocation` | Path to Playwright test files | Yes | `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/PlaywrightTests` |
| `playwrightRepository` | Custom Playwright framework repository URL | No | `https://github.com/itweedie/playwrightOnPowerPlatform.git` |
| `playwrightBranch` | Specific branch, tag, or commit to clone | No | *(default branch)* |
| `browser` | Browser to run tests (chromium, firefox, webkit, all) | Yes | `all` |
| `trace` | Trace mode (off, on, retain-on-failure, on-first-retry) | Yes | `off` |
| `outputLocation` | Directory for test results and reports | Yes | `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)` |
| `appUrl` | Power Platform application URL | No | - |
| `appName` | Power Platform application name | No | - |
| `o365Username` | Office 365 username for authentication | No | - |
| `o365Password` | Office 365 password for authentication | No | - |

#### New Repository Management Parameters *(v1.0.15+)*

The `playwrightRepository` and `playwrightBranch` parameters provide flexibility for teams who:
- Maintain custom Playwright framework configurations
- Need to test against specific versions or feature branches
- Want to use their own forks of the Playwright testing framework
- Require version control over their testing infrastructure

**Examples:**
- Use feature branch: `playwrightBranch: "feature/new-selectors"`
- Pin to specific version: `playwrightBranch: "v2.1.0"`
- Test specific commit: `playwrightBranch: "abc123def456"`
- Custom repository: `playwrightRepository: "https://github.com/yourorg/custom-playwright-framework.git"`

## Example Test Scenarios

### Authentication Test
```javascript
test('Power Apps Login', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(process.env.APP_URL);
  await page.fill('[name="loginfmt"]', process.env.O365_USERNAME);
  await page.click('[type="submit"]');
  await page.fill('[name="passwd"]', process.env.O365_PASSWORD);
  await page.click('[type="submit"]');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(new RegExp(process.env.APP_NAME));
});
```

### Canvas App Interaction
```javascript
test('Form Submission', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(process.env.APP_URL);
  await page.waitForSelector('[data-automation-id="Canvas"]');
  
  // Fill form fields
  await page.click('[aria-label="Name input"]');
  await page.fill('[aria-label="Name input"]', 'Test User');
  
  // Submit form
  await page.click('[aria-label="Submit button"]');
  
  // Verify success
  await expect(page.locator('[aria-label="Success message"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Authentication failures**: Verify credentials and user permissions
- **Element not found errors**: Check for Power Platform loading delays
- **Timeout issues**: Increase timeout values for slow environments
- **"Unknown command: pm" errors**: *(Fixed in v1.0.15)* - Update to the latest version for improved npm command reliability

### Debugging Tools
- Review HTML reports for detailed execution flow
- Use trace files for step-by-step analysis
- Check screenshots for visual verification
- Monitor network logs for connectivity issues
- **New**: Enhanced error logging provides detailed command execution information
